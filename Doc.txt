Program Description:

This program allows the user to simulate a ticketing system(pre-sales) for a cinema theater. The program begins with asking the user to purchase between 1-4 tickets per transaction. After each purchase, the program displays the purchased amount of tickets and those remaining for availability. The program continues until all tickets are sold. The program ends with displaying the user the total number of buyers involved in ticket transactions.

Function: get_ticket_request

Displays the tickets remaining and prompts the user to enter the amount of tickets they want to purchase.

Parameters:
remaining_tickets(int): The number of tickets currently available.

Variables:
Tickets (int) : The number of tickets requested by the user.

Logic:
	
	1.	Display the number of tickets remaining for purchase.
	2.	Prompt the user with asking how many they’ll purchase (1-4).
	3.	 Convert the user input into an integer.
	4.	Return the number of tickets requested.

Return :
Int: The number of tickets requested by the user.	


Function: sell_ tickets

Controls the ticket-selling process by repeatedly collecting the users inputs, validating request, updating the remaining tickets and counting the number of buyers involved until all tickets are sold.

Parameters:

Variables:

TOTAL_TICKETS(int): Constant that stores the remaining number of tickets left during transactions.

total_buyers(int):Accumulator that counts the number of buyers whom purchase tickets.

tickets_requested(int): Stores the number of tickets that are requested by the user for the current purchase.

Logic:

	1.	Initialize TOTAL_TICKETS to 20.
	2.	Set remaining_tickets equal to TOTAl_TICKETS.
	3.	Initialize total_buyers to 0.
	4.	Loop while remaining_tickets is greater than 0.
     - 1. Call get_ticket_request and store the result in tickets_requested.
        2. If tickets_requested is less than 1 or greater than 4, display an invalid request       
            message to user.
        3. Else if tickets_requested is greater than remaining_tickets, display a not enough tickets message to the user.
        4. Else:
                     - Subtract tickets-requested from remaining_tickets.
                     - Increase total_buyers by 1.
                     - Display how many tickets were purchased.
                     - Display how many tickets remain.
     5. When remaining_tickets becomes 0:
          1. Display a message stating that all tickets are sold.
          2. Display the total number of buyers whom purchased tickets.
